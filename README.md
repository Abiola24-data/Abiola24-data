## Hi there 👋

##My name is Abiola Yussuf.
I'm a passionate data analyst with a background in **Data Visualization**, **Data Manipulation**, and **Business Intelligence** tools.
I love using data to solve problems, uncover insights, and help drive strategic decisions.


## 🔭 I’m currently working on building my data analysis toolset which includes:
- **Excel**: Advanced data analysis, pivot tables, VLOOKUP, data cleaning, and automation with macros.
- **SQL**: Writing efficient queries to extract, transform, and manipulate data from relational databases.
- **Power BI**: Creating interactive dashboards and reports to communicate insights to stakeholders.
- **Tableau**: Building dynamic and visually appealing dashboards for complex data sets.

## 🚀 Projects:
Here are some of my key projects:
- **Sales Performance Dashboard (TABLEAU)**: Visualized sales data trends to identify high-performing products and regions.
- **Customer Risk Analysis (POWER BI)**: Analyzed customers who have been engaged in the telecommunication analysis.
- **SQL Query Optimization**: Improved query performance for large datasets, reducing run-time by 50%.

 🌱 I’m currently learning everything
